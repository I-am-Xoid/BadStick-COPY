  ## Other Information
  BadStick was made to be a free and open source tool, not only to make it easier for people to get BadUpdate running on
  their consoles, but also for people to learn. With that being said, nobody has my permission to reupload this or to
  integrate this in other programs without my explicit permission. I am all for people learning off of me, but not people
  stealing my work to re-release as theirs. Simply ask, and I will allow! :)
