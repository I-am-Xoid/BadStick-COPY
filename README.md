# BadStick-COPY (I LEFT ALL CREDITS)

**BadStick-COPY** is a customized version of [BadStick](https://github.com/32BitKlepto/BadStick), rebuilt with a new UI, all-in-one installer, emulation tools, more stealth server options, and other improvements.

It automates the **BadAvatar** process almost instantly, preparing a USB drive for soft-modding an Xbox 360 with minimal user input. Just run the tool, plug in your USB, and itâ€™s ready for use on the console.
